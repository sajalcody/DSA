There can be two cases 

1. we need smallest lexicographically smallest element
   
   Here, we will have to sort the array => O(nlogn)

   then we can swap pairs => n

   total is nlogn

2. we can tell any wave array.

this can be done in O(n) complexity

  1. take 3 elements at a time and bring smallest in middle. leave first two elements and start again from 3rd element
